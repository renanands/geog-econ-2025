- (RP Polecon) Concentrated spatial wealth inequality leads to more crime

- Motivation: Rio. Particular to it is the presence of factions

- Mapa HistÃ³rico dos Grupos Armados do Rio de Janeiro

- "Place X is doomed by how it's positioned" (eg transit grid insertion)
	\leadsto geography -> compacity -> channels in Harari (2020)

- Main point 1: how should I think about factions? 
-- Stationary bandits in conflict with each other?
-- Firms?

- Main point 2: Is this an interesting/promising idea at all?

monopolize force -> utilities, charge for that

factions wont use public transit, but it makes a place richer

expansions in transit and faction activity 

consider factions are constrained by police force eeg in copacabana

terrain helps them technologically > advantage of elevation for factions

reduced-form to start: what happends with transit expansion?
new train line -> more factions? rents go up ok

less or more likely to have any group at all? more than one?


new bus lines too



subway -> more, less contested?

richer -> fations exert more effort, but less benefit to existing at all(ffrbrlopmrny rggrvy)
